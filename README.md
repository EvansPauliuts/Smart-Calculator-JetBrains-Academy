## Work on project. Stage 2/7: 2+2+
### Objectives
Write a program that reads two integer numbers from the same line and prints their sum in the standard output.
Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.

- Write a program that reads two numbers in a loop and prints the sum in the standard output.
- If a user enters only a single number, the program should print the same number.
If a user enters an empty line, the program should ignore it.
- When the command ```/exit``` is entered, the program must print ```"Bye!"``` (without quotes), and then stop.


#### Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (>) represents the user input.

```shell
> 17 9
26
> -2 5
3

> 7
7
> /exit
Bye!
```
