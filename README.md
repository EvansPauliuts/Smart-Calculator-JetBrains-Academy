## Work on project. Stage 4/7: Add subtractions
### Objectives

- The program must calculate expressions like these: ```4 + 6 - 8```, ```2 - 3 - 4```, and so on.
- Modify the result of the ```/help``` command to explain these operations.
- Decompose your program using functions to make it easy to understand and edit later.
- The program should not stop until the user enters the ```/exit``` command.
- If you encounter an empty line, do not output anything.


#### Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (>) represents the user input.

```shell
> 8
8
> -2 + 4 - 5 + 6
3
> 9 +++ 10 -- 8
27
> 3 --- 5
-2
> 14       -   12
2
> /exit
Bye!
```
